## Overview

Task Manager is a full-stack web application designed to manage tasks efficiently. It includes an authentication system with two user roles (Admin and User), a task management board, and functionalities for assigning, viewing, and updating tasks. (This was a challenge project and I have completed this one within 30 hours). Play with the admin and user. Best of Luck. 

## Key Features

1. **Authentication System**:
   - Two user roles: Admin and User.
   - Admin capabilities: add, delete, edit tasks, assign tasks to users, manage task statuses.
   - User capabilities: view assigned tasks, mark tasks as completed, change task status (cannot delete tasks).

2. **Task Management**:
   - Admin can assign tasks to multiple users.
   - Users can view, complete, and change the status of tasks assigned to them.

3. **Board for Task Status**:
   - A board displaying tasks with statuses (To-Do, In Progress, Completed).
   - Drag-and-drop functionality to enhance task management (optional feature).

   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

   ```

### Server Side

1. **Move to Home**:
   ```sh
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of the server directory.
   - Add your MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and other necessary environment variables.

4. **Run the server**:
   ```sh
   npm start
   nodemon index.js
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Client
